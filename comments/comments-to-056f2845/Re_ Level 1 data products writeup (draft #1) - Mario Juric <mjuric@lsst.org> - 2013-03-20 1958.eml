I fear the opposite: your average reader (astronomer) will get
horrendously confused if we begin using our local UML-ish terminology.

Thanks! I'll incorporate these.

Agreed.

I'll define.

Agreed. I should probably add a glossary at the end.

Will do, somewhere in the introduction.

I need to clarify these.

I'd prefer to keep it there, since it kind of is the core of the
document. That's what I want the readers to comment on -- is everything
that's supposed to be in that table really there.

There's an option of switching the table into landscape mode, which may
help.

Eventually yes, but I'd prefer not to right now, at least while it's
being distributed only to a limited subset of the SCs (the collab. chairs).

It's very valuable to keep and show our evolution of thinking about the
database, and the rationale for keeping/removing columns.

Yes, I recall us planning to keep the last ~30 days of images (calexps)
cached on disk -- someone who knows the sizing model please confirm.

If that's the case, then it's not a problem.

Depending on how complicated one wants to make it, it can be very simple
(e.g., just provide a positional match within some matching radius), or
very complicated (use proper motions, colors, morphology, uncertanties,
the whole kitchen sink, to try to come up with as correct linkage as
possible).

The simple positional match is relatively straightforward and should be
easy to provide. I wouldn't want to promise anything beyond that. And
I'm not touching the discussion about whether or how to assign IAU
identifiers with a 64 gigaparsec pole :).
