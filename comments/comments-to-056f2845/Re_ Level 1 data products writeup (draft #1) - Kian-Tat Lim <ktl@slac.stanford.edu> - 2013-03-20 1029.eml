Issuing new DIASources is easy/cheap.

But it's actually worse: what happens to the DIAObjects that now do not
have DIASources pointing to them?  (See below)

I'm OK with DIASources belonging to either DIAObjects or SSObjects but
not both.  I'm a little worried that things may move back and forth.

My comments:

p. 2

"begin the regular survey operations before the end of this decade"
Not sure about that, even with 2011-2020 decade definition.

10,000 sq deg vs. 30,000 sq deg vs. 18,000 sq deg should be clarified more
24.5 vs. 27.5 should be clarified more
Very Deep and Fast all one, or two separate?

p. 3

Kind of confusing to have item 1 be Level 2 and vice versa

Should define "source"
DIASources are detections and measurements
Mention that DIASources can be negative (something moving away or disappearing)?

p. 4

How/why are DIAObjects different from Objects?
How are initial DIAObjects generated in up-to-date database?
Sounds like DIAObjects are only created from DIASources

What happens if multiple DIAObjects associate to the DIASource?

Footnote 5 is backwards.  Foreign key is from DIAObject table and is in
DIASource row.

p. 5

Does DIAObject entry have to be updated immediately?
How much information is needed for the update?
Can it be done incrementally?

Which Data Release database is searched?  Presumably latest available
Is it searched based on the DIASource or the DIAObject (or are they essentially
identical due to the assumption of low proper motion)?

Can two very close DIASources match to the same DIAObject?  Does it matter
which one comes first?

Where/when does prediction of SSObject location occur?
Does prediction of fast-moving non-SSObject locations occur?

Should we really describe MOPS in detail?
Tracks are more than two DIASources -- they are made from tracklets, which are
themselves three DIASources, I believe

p. 6

Putting SSObjects in the DIAObject table is OK for light curves but bad for
association, unless all DIAObjects have positions predicted
Suggest associating to SSObjects then DIAObjects (or vice versa)

p. 7

Having parent-child temporal associations in any sort of Object table does not
make much sense; temporal aspects are captured by Sources
Better to express by having multiple Objects and Sources at same location
Need to figure out what to do with positional association in such cases

Footnote 10: fully live database will be very difficult, particularly with AP
move, if u-t-d DB is considered part of DAC

We have plenty of room in 64 bits as long as we don't want too many coded,
low-entropy fields in the id
Are lookups from the id to other metadata tables too difficult?
ccdExposureId is not just CCD but also visit (should not use term "exposure")?
What about sources detected across CCDs?
ccdExposureId might be inside diaSourceId anyway

p. 10

What about extended variables (comets, asteroid outgassing, light echoes,
lensed variables)?

p. 11

diaObjectId should almost certainly only be 64 bits
Aren't proper motions necessary for correct association of fast movers?

p. 12

Storing light curve in DIAObject is difficult: variable length; use
separate table -- but isn't this just the DIASources?
Querying "nearbyObj" columns is difficult; should probably be separate table

p. 13

If SSObjects are DIAObjects, should record DIAObject id in SSObject table
Actually, likely there will be several DIAObjects for each SSObject; should
they be merged?

p. 14

Include the whole DIAObject record; it's relatively small

How many past DIASources for the DIAObject should be sent?  I think all
(now that I read p. 15, not sure about precovery data)

We have space for two 30x30 cutouts; people wanted pixels not URIs

p. 16

9 months of new DIASources may not match well with reprocessed DIAObjects
For pixels, could maybe do 8.5 months in 2 weeks, then 2 weeks in 1 day
 
New releases of u-t-d DB may also have new columns
