Hi Mario,

It is very good and will be a valuable document.  My comments below.  =
Thanks!

Overall:

I'd go ahead and use AstroObject where you have Object, we'll be using =
that term in the other models, might as well introduce it now.  It is =
more important where it might be confused with Object in the software =
engineering sense, but even in this context, it let's us reserve =
"object" for more generic sense of the word.

pp. 2, sec 1.1:

I found myself having to be careful distinguishing between DIAObject and =
Object while reading.  It's a bit of a catch-22 in having to describe =
Level 1 and Level 2 separately when introducing both.  I think it would =
help people reading later in sections 2.1, 2.2 if this introductory =
section at least list the Level 1 and Level 2 data products that you =
describe in detail later.  It should be clear right up front that these =
are different things.  I realize there is a "document flow" issue, but =
it feels that you can do this at a summary level first, then go into =
Level 1 and Level 2 in detail as you have now. Also, you introduce the =
two types of image analyses in the reverse numerical order to the =
"Level" of their data products.  Here is my suggestion for a revised =
1.1:

1.1 Level 1 and 2 Data Products

LSST Data Management will perform two, somewhat overlapping in =
scientific intent, types of image analyses:

Analysis of difference images, with the goal of detecting and =
characterizing astrophysical phenomena revealed by their time-dependent =
nature.  This is done on a nightly or daily basis and produces Level 1 =
data products: DIASource, DIAObject, SSObject, Transient Alert.  The =
detection of supernovae superimposed on bright extended galaxies is an =
example of this analysis.

Analysis of science images, with the goal of detecting and =
characterizing astrophysical objects.  This is done on an annual basis =
and produces Level 2 data products: Source, Object, Data Release.  =
Characterization of faint galaxies on deep co-adds is an example of this =
analysis.

The two types of analysis have different requirements on timeliness. =
Changes in flux or position of objects may need to be immediately =
followed up, lest interesting information may be lost. Thus, the primary =
results of analysis of difference images =96 =93transient alerts=94 =96 =
belong to =93Level 1=94 data products and generally need to be broadcast =
within 60 seconds of shutter close. The analysis of science images is =
less time sensitive, and will be done as a part of annual data release =
process.=20

We may also want a table or something graphic to reflect these.  I am =
thinking of an update version of the old data products slide.

pp. 4 section 2.1 and in general:

I would recommend avoiding mentioning specific Pipelines (e.g. =
Association Pipeline) and in the same sense as our use cases, just talk =
about "processing" i.e. association processing.  This is because, over =
time, our notion of what processing occurs in what pipelines has =
evolved, and may evolve again.  This would make the document insensitive =
to such changes.

pp. 4, section 2.2:

Avoid use of "snaps" or define.

Use of "up-to-date database" needs forward reference to section 2.4 for =
definition.

pp. 5, section 2.2:

Define "Data Release database"

#8 uses "payload" and "packet" to mean the same thing

pp. 8, section 2.5 and subsections:

This enumeration of all fields works for up-date-database where there =
aren't many columns.  When you get to (Astro)Object table it has so many =
columns this may be unwieldy in a document.  Consider moving to =
appendix.

I assume notes regarding what was removed, added, will be suppressed in =
document to Science Collaborations.

pp. 15, footnote 24

I believe this was requested for a 30 day buffer by Chris Smith a while =
back


pp. 17, section 2.9

I believe EPO asked for a "matching service" to match IDs from one DR to =
another at the last AHM, but we declined to provide it, leaving them to =
do so.  You or K-T may recall more details.
