Will do. What I had in mind was just simple positional association that
takes errors into account, for both cases. I.e.:

* Predict positions+error ellipses of both stars and asteroids at time
of observation. In case of stars, use proper motion + paralax, in case
of SSObjects, the Keplerian orbit. This gives the "instance catalog"

* For all detected SSObjects, given their (Gaussian) error ellipses,
find the most likely associated source in the instance catalog.

Yep, that was just a mistake.

Re. the matching, if we do both DIASource->DIAObject and
DIASource->Object, I'm worried that will lead to confusion as to which
one to use. Also, while I could think of use cases that required the
DIASource-DIAObject link, I couldn't come up with any that would need a
direct DIASource-Object association and that cannot (or should not) be
done via DIASource->DIAObject->Object lookup.

Re. picking a "best guess", I imagined they'd be sorted on
nearbyObjectDist so the first one is in some sense the most likely. I'll
clarify the text. We could go beyond that and compute the most likely
one taking positional errors into account. Should we?

Zeljko has also commented on this one; I'm happy to multiply maggies by
the appropriate factor if there's consensus that the fluxes of absolute
standards are now sufficiently well known to do so.

Ahh good point; I *have* thought about it, but I forgot to add that to
the text/tables.

The proposal is that for trails whose length is higher than some
threshold, we go back to the individual snaps and try to measure
direction of motion. We could "mini-multifit" an extended trail model
with speed as an added parameter, and all other parameters (length,
angle) fixed.

Honestly, I just carried these over from the previous baseline w/o a
clear idea how they'd be computed. The feedback was uniformly against
keeping them.

That was my sense as well, but I wanted to hear from Jacek and K-T first.

MOID, if I understand it correctly, is the distance of closest approach
of two ellipses that share a focus (in 3D). While there's no analytic
solution, there are numeric algorithms that don't look too scary (once
you penetrate the notation). Eg.
http://www.mathnet.or.kr/mathnet/kms_tex/986160.pdf.

There will be a a 1:1 map between our object IDs and IAU naming
conventions (e.g., LSSTDR5 JHHMMSS.ss+DDMMSS.s, though I'd prefer to
promote sanity by using decimal instead of sexagesimal system). We can
provide a UDF that does the formatting. But this will still change IDs
from DR to DR.

As for matching objects between releases, and then providing unique
names to those matches, I'm hoping that someone in the SCs who strongly
feels about it will come to us with a proposed algorithm :).

Thanks, these were very useful!!,
