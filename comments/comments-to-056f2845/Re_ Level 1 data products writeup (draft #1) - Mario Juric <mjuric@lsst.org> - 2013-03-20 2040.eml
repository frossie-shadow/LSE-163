I gave up on that; as you point out, too many nasty side effects.

I lifted this entire paragraph from the Overview paper. I guess Zeljko

Yes, but item 1 is also what's usually done, so if you think about it

I'll see how to incorporate this, w/o going into too much detail.

Explained in Sec 2.4 (I should forward-reference it).

Correct.

Can't happen. We associate a DIASource to only a single DIAObject. This
will lead to a certain number of mis-associations, but I'm not sure if
the added complexity of multiple (or probabilistic) associations is
worth it.

Before the alert is issued. The idea is that someone querying the
database after receiving the alert will see the information consistent
with the alert (assuming a subsequent event didn't further change it).

> How much information is needed for the update?

Let's see:
* mean position
* proper motion and parallax (if we choose to fit these)
* mean flux (for that band)
* period and other light-curve characteristics
* nearby objects from DR

Basically, that's more/less the entire record. To compute it, we may
need all DIASources.

Possibly. Depends of the chosen algorithms. It would certainly be
desirable to be able to do so, but I'm not sure if we'll be able to
guarantee it.

I don't think any of these should be especially computationally
intensive. Most are relatively straight-forward statistics or fits.

I'd say DIAObject, and taking into account the proper motion (I need to
add this to the document).

No and probably yes.

My intuition is that this shouldn't happen often with real astrophysical
objects, but if we have lots of false positives, they may contaminate
the DIAObjects.

Both occur when we build the "instance catalog".

I think this is at a sufficiently high level that it's relatively
algorithm independent.

You're right, I got my terminology wrong (how embarrassing). I'll
correct it.

I've given up on this idea -- a DIASource should be associated to either
a DIAObject or an SSObject.

Yep. This was a bad idea.

OK. Let's get back to this once I incorporate all comments.

Is there room for a 'Data Release' field (4 bits, 5 if we want to play
it safe)?

> Are lookups from the id to other metadata tables too difficult?

No. My desire for unique IDs is not intended so that people would decode
them to avoid accessing metadata tables; it's to prevent errors where
Joe Q. Astronomer will write down an ID and three years later query a
different DR, only to get back a completely different object.

Good point. Should we use ccdVisitId?

Haven't really thought about it... Let me noodle it a little...

I think it's beyond our scope (the characterization vs. classification
mantra).

They are, but an alternative stance is that that is not time-critical
science and can be done off of DRP data where we will fit the proper
motions.

I think we should fit it on difference images, since *probably* it's not
that expensive (I'm tempted to claim it's just a linear fit, but
parallax terms don't quite make it so for nearby stars).

Could be -- that's a logical schema discussion for you and Jacek.

I'm thinking that once DIASources are linked to SSObjects, they should
be "unlinked" from their DIAObjects (and the DIAObjects deleted if that
action made them orphaned).

Makes it a lot easier.

I'd say just the current one. The idea is that the DIAObject will
contain enough information to allow for classification, plus the brokers
will likely have a local copy of our DR+u-t-d databases to provide more
sophisticated filtering.

That said, if we can afford sending out all DIASources with each alert,
we should consider it.

OK, I'll make a note of that.

They will get matched to whatever DIAObjects are there, and those that
have no match will create new ones. It's exactly the same procedure that
would happen if we magically had the reprocessed DR database ready in a
day so that no catch-up was needed.

That's a possibility. I heard that Fermi (the satellite) does it like
that for new data releases.

So you're worried that we couldn't simply replay the new DIASources
because of that? Good point.

Do we have enough computing to catch up on pixel-level? I think that
would roughly ~double the diffim processing budget for DR1/DR2, becoming
progressively easier with every subsequent release.


Thanks -- I'll be incorporating these over the next few days!
