Hi Mario - My comments are:

  * I would remove the "if at all" from the coupling of up-to-date database to data release 
database. People will truly want/need this, so we might as well do it.

* DiaSource table will not necessarily have sky, as the difference images have no sky.

  * SNR = of detection, or of (Psf) measurement?

* remove trailWidth. I don't see why we don't forward model a line convolved withthe Psf. Should 
write a paper on that...

  * There is value in extendednessof DiaSources (in particular, for recognizing comets)

  * Shouldn't H,G beper-filterfor SSObject?  No point in taking our observations to V-band...

  * Define the process of arriving at the "limited number" of DiaSources that have precovery forced 
phot. E.g. they are new.

  * I presume that we will make new templates during Data Release productions. This will yield an 
entirely new set of difference images. Also, do we plan on doing amp- or sensor-level diffim in 
nightly processing? If amp-level, specifify that the data release diffims will be different in that 
they will likely be sensor-level.

      <pre wrap="">Dear DM crowd (and Zeljko),
	Attached to this e-mail you'll find the first draft of a writeup on
Level 1 processing and data products. I'm asking for your initial round
of comments, preferably by this Friday. Over the weekend, I'll
incorporate any commends I receive and would aim to send it for round #2
of comments to the Science Council and the Science Collaboration chairs.
By the end of the month I (optimistically) hope to have ready part #2 of
that document, that deals with Level 2. We're aiming for an external
review in late May.

	The document is intended to capture at a detailed yet readable and
understandable level how we plan to generate L1 products, when, what
they will consist of, and how they will be distributed. Our DB team will
use it to derive the details of database and schema design, the science
teams will use it to verify that LSST plans capture science
requirements, and it will be used to populate the UML model to enable
requirements tracking and software design consistency checks. It will
also be the primary document we will give to our data products
reviewers, and it's not inconceivable that we may turn it into a
companion to the "Overview Paper".

	Please comment on technical feasibility, scientific completeness,
clarity, style, etc. At this point, the document is a statement on what
I would *like* to be done, not necessarily what we actually *can* do
given the resources. There are still many TBDs and TODOs in the text --
your thoughts on those would be appreciated. There are some new ideas
(e.g., "trailed source model"). There are also some things that were
left out wrt. the previous baseline (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://ls.st/wxv">http://ls.st/wxv</a>) -- please point
out those that I should have kept.

PS: In case you need it, TeX sources are available at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://ls.st/r7z">http://ls.st/r7z</a>
PPS: The document has *not* been spell-checked. Ignore any such mistakes.
PPPS: I owe many of you replies to e-mails; I'll do that tomorrow while
on the way to FNAL for DES review. I've been largely ignoring e-mail
today in order to finish this document.

Cheers,
</pre>
