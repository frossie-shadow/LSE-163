As the masses have said, nice document.

					R

Section 2.1  The S/N =3D 5 for DIASources isn't graven in stone (but I =
bet it's < 6).  I think it's a bit clearer to say "Change in flux at a =
given position"

How do we handle asteroids on top of variables? (If we do).  Asteroids =
on constant brightness stars are handled by your list of matched =
Objects.

2.2 point 3.  "Force-photometered" (ughh) as a PSF?  What if it's =
extended [probably trailed, but who knows for sure?]?

We may well detect at 5 and alert at 5.3 or something;  this information =
must go out in the VOEvent.

2.3 Point 1.  Are those tracklets? =20

point 2.  What happens when previous DIASources become dis-associated =
with an SSObject?

Will we be using J2000?  Or some GAIA-based system?

Why are we carrying sky and skyErr for all DIASources?  There was some =
discussion with ACB on this, but I think I'd rather trust the quoted =
errors than use the localBackground to estimate them myself.  The only =
use that I know of for sky in the SDSS object tables was to compare the =
local to the global value to see how important deblending had been --- =
and there must be a better way of capturing that.

I'm not getting into naming-of-errors.  As Jacek says, there was quite a =
history of discussion which we should read before reopening this.

I don't understand, "SNR".  Is this the level at which we think we =
detected it (which is a per-visit number) or a per-object S/N ratio, in =
which case what's the difference from psfFluxErr/psfFlux

I wouldn't use "Log" to mean Log_{10}.  And I might go with Log_e =3D=3D =
Ln anyway

I'm not sure we need all those trail parameters (and covariances etc.).  =
I'd be amazed if e.g. the angle from the moments didn't give the trail =
angle to sufficient accuracy.  I bet we don't need all the moment =
covariances either --- in fact, I'm not sure we need a trailed model and =
a moment too (are you thinking about comets?).  All of these inflate the =
table significantly, as almost all sources will be well fit by a single =
PSF model.  We could have a secondary table, I suppose, for a small =
subset [normally something to which I strenuously object]

Do we really need the extinction (and two numbers to boot)?  It's been =
applied to the fluxes, and you'd have to be really poking down in the =
detritus to care about those values.

You'll get into trouble with users by removing "extendedness" -- they =
want to be told the Truth.  Add a UDF?

I'd assume that the moments were the standard adaptive gaussian moments =
(I don't know any better).  Or they could be a trailed Gaussian --- that =
might be a good idea in the context of merging trails and moments.

I'm not sure that we should marginalise over priors to get expectation =
values.  My usual preference is to quote the likelihood and allow the =
users to convert to probabilities (of course, quoting a mean and =
variance rather implies that the likelihood is Gaussian.  And we don't =
have post-Gaussian parameters saved [or calculated?]).  This is OK with =
me.

At Data release time, moving and variable sources can and will be =
included in the deblending codes.

There are also typical slavic grammatical errors;  I'd be happy to fix =
these up at a later date.

And some comments on previous comments:

>> What about extended variables (comets, asteroid outgassing, light =

Isn't this measuring proper parameters, rather than classifying?

>> If SSObjects are DIAObjects, should record DIAObject id in SSObject =
table Actually, likely there will be several DIAObjects for each =
SSObject; should they be merged?
>>=20
>=20
> I'm thinking that once DIASources are linked to SSObjects, they should =
be "unlinked" from their DIAObjects (and the DIAObjects deleted if that =
action made them orphaned).

This would make sense if we made 100% correct linkages.  In reality =
we'll make mistakes;  it's probably OK to delete the DIAObjects and =
recreate them if the linkage turns out to be wrong.

>>=20
>> My intuition is that this shouldn't happen often with real =
astrophysical objects, but if we have lots of false positives, they may =
contaminate the DIAObjects.
>=20
> How will we prevent multiple DIASources matching to a DIAObject? =
Determining that another DIASource in the same visit has already matched =
will be somewhat difficult (especially if at the edge of a =
parallelization boundary).

I think Mario's assumption was probably that the DIASources were sparse. =
 As soon as that's not true (if it ever is --- depends on e.g. =
cleanliness of subtractions in the bulge in the presence of proper =
motion and DCR) this problem is very hard.  For example, not only are =
there multiple possible matches, but there'll be the problem of =
deblending consistently (including across boundaries).
