Hi Mario,

Read it on the plane back from Chicago.  It's good to see some new
thinking!

I have a few comments.  I haven't read everyone else's comments yet - so
apologies for any duplications (and, of course, contradictions...)

Tim

p. 4 "DIASources detected on visits taken at diff erent times are
associated to DIAObjects."  It would be good to say a bit more about the
association algorithm in the non Solar System case.

p.5 "are analyzed for potential pairs, forming tracks".   If you want to
adhere to the vocabulary used within MOPS, these would be "tracklets"

p. 6  I'm not completely convinced of the rationale for matching
DIASource-to-DIAObject, but not DIASource-to-Object.   There is a poor
man's DIAObject-to-Object match in the DIAObject table, so doesn't that
couple the up-to-date DB with the DR DB just as tightly?  And in terms of
the poor man's match, I think having N possible matches is fine, but I
think it's silly not to pick a "best guess" one, with an algorithm that is
known. That is the first thing everyone will want to do, so why not do it
for them?

p. 8  There is already a standard unit for flux that is used very widely in
astronomy and physics - the Jansky.   I think it is extremely
counterproductive to invent our own!   Will we define our own units for
angles and time?!

p.9  Your footnote on the trailed source model brought to mind one of the
costs of combining snaps at a very early stage of the processing:  one has
a 180 deg ambiguity in the  direction of trails that have substantial
length.   MOPS could use this information productively.

p. 10  Where in the processing are you thinking those extinction terms in
DIASource will be calculated?   The information we have at that point will
allow us to get a rough extinction measure, but I'm not sure we can
separate it into gray and non-gray usefully.

p. 14, Section 2.6.  I'm pretty convinced that the postage stamps should be
sent with the alerts.  If not, there will just be a flood of requests for
them, because brokers will likely do that automatically.

p. 13  I'm not sure why we're including MOIDs.   I'm guessing this came
from the solar system collab, but it does puzzle me.  Seems like
determining them could be a significant computational task, given the
number of objects we'll have.   It would be good to say why they're there.

p. 17  Section 2.9.   I like the idea of having completely disjoint sets of
ID's!   I'd argue, though, that we want some kind of map of ID->IAUName for
each DR, where the IAUName would strive to be a fixed name attached to an
astrophysical object,   I of course recognize this map can't be perfect,
and so will everyone else.   But I still claim it would be very useful for
astronomers.
