So what's the algorithm for choosing?  Shortest distance, and random if
two are the same?

The problem is organizing the data so that we can recompute all of these
rapidly after association.  We were going to have a special binary dump
of the (DIA)Object table to do assoc.  Now we'll either have to query
for DIASources (slow) or dump them, too (large).  Bandwidth requirements
will increase a lot.

How will we prevent multiple DIASources matching to a DIAObject?
Determining that another DIASource in the same visit has already matched
will be somewhat difficult (especially if at the edge of a
parallelization boundary).

This isn't mentioned anywhere, is it?  This catalog is itself a problem,
as it needs to be computed for every visit.  I think it may have to be
done virtually -- we match with a larger radius to the recorded (mean)
RA/dec and then correct using the proper motion to filter the multiple
matches to the best one.  On the other hand, we may have enough prep
time per visit while the camera is doing its job to predict locations
for all in-view SSObjects and DIAObjects.

Which one takes priority?

Probably that would be better.

This is not about classification.  It's about what measurements we're
making.  If we're not characterizing well enough for someone else to do
the classification, we'll hear about it.

But fast movers can be variable/transient as well, and maybe trigger
follow-up, no?

[Note to Jacek: a live diaObjectId index in the DIASource table will be
an absolute necessity to find orphaned DIAObjects; this will add seeks
to use and update the index.]

Hmm.  Not sure that the brokers can maintain a useful-enough copy of the
DR+u-t-d databases just based on the alerts.  And any ad hoc replication
system is bound to get out of sync and cause problems.

It looks like you're requiring us to have all the DIASources anyway to
update the DIAObject, so we might as well send them.

OIC.  We use the detections/measurements but not the ids from the
replayed DIASources.  Yes, that's OK.

There's another issue, though: which template?  The reprocessed
DIAObjects may have used a newer/better template than the replayed ones.
Pixel-level reprocessing could use the same template as the reprocessed.

No, I wasn't, but that is an issue, too.

It's not in the model now, but we probably have enough.
