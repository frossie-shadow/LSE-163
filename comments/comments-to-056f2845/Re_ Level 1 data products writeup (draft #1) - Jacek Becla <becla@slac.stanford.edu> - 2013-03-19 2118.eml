Mario,

Nice document! Here are my comments, observations and questions:

1) page 14, "we require that queries executed at a known point
in time against some version of the up-to-date db be repeatable
at a later data". To the best of my knowledge this is NOT part
of the current official baseline, e.g. I know it came up in
discussions with Joshua Bloom, we think it is the right thing
to do, and based on quick check the cost of doing it seems
reasonable etc, but we should make it clear that it is a change
to the baseline, and I'd caution against promising something
very hard too fast. For instance, you "casually" ;) say on
page 6  that "DIASource records are updated to point to the new
DIAObject record". Keeping track of where they pointed prior
to that update is actually non trivial - that simple pointer
update may result is producing a copy of a DIASources
(I can think of cheaper solutions from storage perspective,
but convoluted from querying perspective)

2) there is something wrong with pointers to SSObject in your
proposed schema. Given you said on page 8 that DIASource.diaObjectId
"cannot be null", I am guessing that every diasource
will have its diaobject, even if that diasource belongs
to ssobject. Is that the case? Further, (still page 8) you are
unsure if we need both diaObject and ssObject ids. In your
schema the DIAObject table does not point to SSObject,
so if we don't keep the pointer to SSObject in DIAObject
(when applicable), how can we find it?

3) you introduced 128 bit ids, is that really necessary?
We don't have any 128 bit ids in any of our baseline tables.
We do have composite keys, but if that is what you mean,
I think we should say it explicitly

4) Page 4, you say "separate rows in the Object table for
DiaObjects. Do you really mean "rows" here? (which would
imply exactly the same schema), or "columns". And second,
do you mean Object table from DR, or DIAObject?

5) page 8, filterId in DIASource - this is internal optimization,
(we can get it through ccdExposureId), so let's not cloud the
picture with denormalization for convenience/speed here.

6) all columns that represent errors - our standard naming
convention is "Sigma".

7) page 14 (bottom) + page 15 (top) - I'd not be so specific
with "createdTAI", "deletedTAI", it is an implementation detail
that we need to discuss much more before putting in
an official document. I'd be ok with saying something like
select * from DIASource WHERE "data is valid as of YYYY-MM-DD"
without implying how we are going to implement it.

8) page 16. When we replace the up-to-date with the latest
one produced by DR, should we be worrying about killing
reproducibility? Perhaps we have to keep the up-to-date
that we are replacing? - we would have to run it through
spreadsheets to see how much it'd cost.

9) also related to page 16. What happens if we replay
the alert production with the latest algorithms, and
that "generate" new alerts that we didn't generate
during the original production? Should we send such
alerts out?


I might read it again and have more comments...

Thanks,
Jacek
