Sounds good! The way I see it: the science-oriented document
like the one you started putting together covers the
needs without going into any denormalization-type
optimizations. We do have the reasonable amount of
optimizations built into the baseline schema, it is
important from sizing perspective. So yes, the db team
will deal with denormalizing.

I'll just note that:
a) we used to have "Err", but people didn't like it,
    and preferred "Sigma"
b) switching is easy these days, because we maintain
    schema in ascii file and have a script to update EA.
    It was much more painful in the past.

Well, we don't do the same yet, I think we will once we
start squeezing more out of our database (to get max speed
and reproducibility) but hopefully we will be able to
hide a lot of the ugliness behind qserv.

Then we need to think about issues like what stays on disk.
This can get expensive rather quickly

Thanks,
