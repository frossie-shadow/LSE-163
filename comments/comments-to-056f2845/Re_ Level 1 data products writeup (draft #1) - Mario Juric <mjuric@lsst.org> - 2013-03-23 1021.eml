Everyone,
	Thanks for the comments -- it will likely take me a few days to
incorporate them into the text and send an updated version.

	A question for Jacek/K-T: does MySQL support computed columns (I found
info on Google saying that MariaDB does, but I'm not sure about MySQL)?

	I ask because it's clear that we'll want to store flux, but it's
equally clear that the majority of users will want to query magnitudes.
The transformation is straightfowrard (log, multiply, add), and may be
best implemented as a computed value.

Cheers,
- M.
