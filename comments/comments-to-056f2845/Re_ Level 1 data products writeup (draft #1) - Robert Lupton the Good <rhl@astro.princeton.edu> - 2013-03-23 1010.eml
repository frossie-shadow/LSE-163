As you well know, the choice of Maggies v. Jy depends on how well you =
think we know the calibration.  If you think that the Maggies are on an =
absolute scale, then yes, we should use Jy instead (for an assumed SED, =
presumably the same flat choice as for AB mags).  If you don't think =
that we know how to do the transformation reliably, we should Maggies as =
the flux unit, and quote our current best estimate of the correction to =
Jy.  Our zero points will also have errors of course, so the values in =
Maggies will also be subject to change, but I think separating the two =
problems makes sense.

asinh mags solve a different problem.  If you want to use a cut like (g =
- r) to represent a flux ratio you need to use a logarithmic scale.  If =
it's still true that databases cannot optimise queries involving ratios, =
then we may want to use magnitudes in the DB.  If we do, I think an =
asinh magnitude is still a good idea as negative fluxes are a reality.  =
You should have a UDF to return a linear unit, of course.

Sorry.
