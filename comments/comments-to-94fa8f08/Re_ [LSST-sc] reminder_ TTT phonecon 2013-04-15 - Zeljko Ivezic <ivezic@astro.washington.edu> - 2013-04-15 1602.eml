        Hi Mario,

this document is turning out quite well! I have a few more minor =
comments on
the latest version (some others were already addressed):=20

- Sec 2.2.1, the second bullet: should we add that threshold SNR is TBD?
- do Objects know that some DIAObjects are linked to them?
- do DIAObjects know about DIAObjects obtained during the same night?=20
  that is, can we improve the selection robustness by deploying followup
  *after the second visit*?=20
- am I correctly understanding that snaps are *not* used to measure=20
  variability? Tony often mentions this possibility in the context of=20
   "unknown unknowns". It turns out that light curve derivative of=20
   1 mag/hr is a good separator between very rare true transients
   such as gamma-ray burst afterglow and variable stars. With 17 sec=20
   between two snaps, this is 5 millimag. Therefore, snaps could indeed
   be vary valuable for robustly finding rare transients (especially if =
the=20
   second visit confirms it).=20
- Sec 2.2.2, the second bullet: how do you know that something is an
    artifact?=20
- 30 days shows up multiple times; how much freedom do we have to
  make it longer (for SNe and tidal disruption events, we may want to=20
  have 3-4 months)
- editing: I think paragraph starting with "Philosophically=85" from =
page 9
  would be better after the first paragraph in Sec 2.3 (page 8)
- Sec 2.3.1: it would be useful to add "20,000/sq.deg./hour" after=20
  "2000 DIASources per visit"
- I remember seeing discussion of the following somewhere so it may=20
  be superfluous: "standard deviation" is used incorrectly in most =
cases;
  first, std. dev. is defined for distributions, not functions (and thus =
there is=20
  no such a thing as std. dev. of the likelihood); second, we mix =
uncertainty
  and std. dev. in most instances (if Description says "uncertainty", =
then=20
  why Name uses Stdev, instead of obvious Unc?)
- footnote #30: "a model" instead of "an model"; also, wouldn't =
"PSF-convolved=20
  line" be better as "line convolved with the PSF"?  Though I =
acknowledge that=20
  this survived "the red pen of MAS" so it's probably ok either way=85
- footnote #31: back to snaps: is it really totally off the table to use=20=

  snap information?
- Table 1: why is flux from sources in nmgy and the sky surface =
brightness
  is uncalibrated (in DN)?=20
- we need to distinguish ISM extinction and atmospheric extinction
- Table 2: given that Names can have at least 11 characters, why do=20
  we call parallax "plx"? Why not "parallax"?
- Table 2: here psFluxStdev appears to really be standard deviation; why
  then to call it width in Description? (psFluxErr would be better as =
psFluxUnc)
- Table 2: Type for lcChar - shouldn't M be N (or N-> in Description?=20
- Table 2: std. dev. in lsStdev is a good example of inappropriate use;
   here we should provide uncertainty in the best-fit period
- Table 2: nearbyObj etc: I think it would be (more) useful to have the=20=

  brightest object within XX arcsec, and/or how many objects within XX =
arcsec,
  where XX is about 10 arcsec
- Table 3: isn't the size of oeCov 28 (and not 21)?=20
- Table 3: earlier we used log likelihood and here we use chi2; we =
should
  be consistent
- Sec 2.3.5: it's good to have it! I would rename gFlux as gFluxExp to =
make
  it more obvious (in contrast to gFluxML)
- Sec 2.3.6: missing "in" in "error IN absolute calibration" after eq. 1
- Sec 2.3.7: "one preceding the most recent one" can be said as =
"penultimate"
- Sec 2.4.1: it might be more useful to bin 2x2 the 30x30 pixel stamps;=20=

    the volume stays the same, but more useful for this purpose

  Cheers, Zeljko=20
