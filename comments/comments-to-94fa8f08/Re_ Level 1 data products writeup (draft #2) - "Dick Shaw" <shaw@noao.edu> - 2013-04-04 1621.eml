I confess I can't think of much useful processing that could be done on a 6 
arcsec stamp that won't already have been done (much better) by the DM 
pipeline. Particularly for alerts on extended sources (e.g., galaxies or 
nebulosity). If feedback from the community suggests adding much more metadata 
than can be comfortably packaged into an alert payload, down-scoping the 
MEF(3) FITS file to a .jpeg would be one of the things I would consider.
