Hi Dick,
	Thanks for the excellent comments! I know the grammar has (more than a
few) rough patches, but we'll work on that closer to the review.

This has already been suggested, but I'm trying to resist it. Really,
these tables are the *core* of this document, and everything else is
there to provide sufficient information to the reader to tell whether
the columns we plan to provide/measure are sufficient for their science
case.

The footnotes are my attempt to keep the balance between being
relatively high-level in the document, and providing more information to
those who want to know more.

15 is an example where I failed. I converted it into a paragraph.

I'd prefer to keep those. They're there to provide hints to our team.
Outside readers can just ignore them.

I think you're seeing the effects of the evolution of this document to
its current state. Once we're closed to the review, someone with a good
eye for editing may need to give it some cut-and-paste treatment.

That's a good point -- we've said nothing about the images.

I added a new section discussing these (2.3.4).

I'd prefer not to go into such level of detail: a) the readers may be
confused why we're trying to define the terms they believe (rightly or
not) they understand, and b) we ourselves haven't fully defined the
details of how these images are going to be produced.

Good point. I've tried to use "alert" whenever possible, unless I really
wanted to specifically say VOEvent.

I added a caveat.

I don't understand how would you represent the difference in brightness
(both positive and negative) in magnitudes? Are you proposing a separate
+/- column?

I changed that sentence to better reflect what I wanted to say (it's a
hypothetical).

No. There's a maximum of ~20 alerts you can get per image.

Some more information has been added to that section which I hope will
make it clearer. What we're trying to say is that a) LSST will provide
basic brokering services for everyone but b) we'd really prefer if the
community organized and operated a public event broker service to do this.

We don't have the bandwidth to send a full stream to anyone who requests
it. It's also unlikely to be useful -- I doubt one can follow up more
than ~20 alerts per visit (those few who will may get special treatment).

You're right, I fixed the wording.

In the end, a DIAObject is created if an association is not found.

Changed these to nmgy/arcsec^2

It's important to have this discussion for our database team to
understand what will be expected of them.

I added a (brief) section on how templates are created. I don't think
there's a need to go into much detail about this here, since I want to
focus the readers' attention on the catalogs more than the images.

Both of these are here more for the benefit of our DB/DRP teams, than
the outside reader. I agree that some may be confused, but that may be
hard to avoid given the complexity of this document.

Thanks for the comments! I hope to have the next draft ready soon (and
move on to Level 2).
