Template-time one will not exist; we'll median the templates so any
moving objects (and artifacts) do not show up.

Done.

Only Object->DIAObject. But the match has to be repeated every time a
new DIASource is matched to a DIAObject, because the DIAObject's
centroid may change. That is, it's not just for new DIAObjects.

We're allowed to batch per-visit updates. If we think of this as a
series of sequence points, here's what they would be:

1) take exposure & readout
2) perform DIA analysis
3) update the database with results from #2
4) users see data updated by #3
5) transmit the alerts

The intent is that someone who receives an alert is guaranteed to find
it in the database as well.

As we discussed, diffims are mentioned in the current baseline as a L1
data product, so we may need to accommodate this.

For now, I'm treating DIAForcedSource the same as a DIASource (but with
a, say, 'FORCED' flag set). We may split the tables up in the logical
schema.

Important note: only PSF photometry will be done for forced photometry,
so the forced table will be narrower.

We may need to support this for other reasons (eg., access to diffims in
Level 3). The whole issue of what's on tape (and how) and what's on disk
will need to be revisited.

Thanks for the comments, once I incorporate all others I'll put out a
new draft (or a "release candidate"),
