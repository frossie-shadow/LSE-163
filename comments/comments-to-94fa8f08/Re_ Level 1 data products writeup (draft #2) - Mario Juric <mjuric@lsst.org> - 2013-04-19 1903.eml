Hmm, I can't find a good place to add that in. Entire section 2.3.8 is
devoted to it, though.

The difference of forced flux and flux on diffim should carry some
information about this?

Yup. It's a TBD issue how to handle these. The real question is when (if
ever) we stop doing forced-photometry measurements (say, if the
DIAObject has not been seen in a while). I added it as an issue in the
final section.

From two visits.

Just to leave open the possibility that the two may be different (in
principle, they are, otherwise we wouldn't be re-measuring after detection).

The idea is that we would determine these from difference images, even
in the absence of the Object table. It's not clear how good of an idea
this is. We need to think through how to handle objects with parallaxes
and proper motions in diffims (they'll leave dipoles all around). It's
recorded as an issue.

I'm not sure what you mean. What would be an example query?

It's the bandwidth that worries me. Imagine 100 users with ~10 MB/s
streams pointed to each of them. That's 10 Gbps of outgoing bandwidth.

I don't think we're sized for that much (Mike would know). In any case,
I prefer to err on the side of controlling expectations.
