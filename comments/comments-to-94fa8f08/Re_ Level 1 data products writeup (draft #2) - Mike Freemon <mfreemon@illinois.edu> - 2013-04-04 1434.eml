Hi Mario,

Minor comments.

Section 1.1

"Thus the primary results of analysis of difference images -- newly 
discovered transients -- generally need to be broadcast as transient 
alerts within 60 seconds of shutter close."

I believe this should be 60 seconds from readout complete, not shutter 
close.

Section 2.4.1

Has it been decided that the VOEvents will contain the cutout images 
(rather than a link to the cutout images)?

Section 2.4.2

Are all VOEvent Brokers required to implement/deploy the LSST-specific 
capabilities (the user defined filters)?  If so, how is that enforced? 
If not, why can't a subscriber request all alerts (not that their system 
can handle it, but what is in place to prevent it)?  Are these LSST 
customizations to the standard VOEvent brokers, or LSST-specific 
customizations (to be proposed) to the VO standards?  Note: This is a 
partial duplicate of an existing bullet in the Open Issues section.

- Mike
