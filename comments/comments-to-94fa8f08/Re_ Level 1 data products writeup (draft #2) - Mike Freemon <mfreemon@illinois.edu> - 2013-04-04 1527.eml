Hi Mario,

Sounds good.  The only followup thought I would raise is that the 
VOEvent broker servers are not LSST's.  This whole area (e.g. who is 
responsible for the event distribution network) is not well defined yet. 
  I would recommend that Ray be added to this discussion as the LSST VO 
Lead.

- Mike
