Dick,

	Some quick responses...

	I think this is dangerous; the specifics of what is measured
and how seem to be quite important.

> A reader would have to read footnote 37 on page 16 before discovering

	Footnote 37 does not say that we will be *publishing* the cache
of processed images.

	Actually, the document as a whole neglects image products as
opposed to catalog products; this is indeed something that should be
fixed.

	The first part of this is correct.  The latency for retrieval of
an arbitrary calibrated image cutout may vary depending on its age.  We
do not currently plan to publish difference images other than the
postage stamps included in the alerts.  If those need to be part of the
L1 Data Products, we will need to make changes.

	I think at least the position is fixed for "forced-photometry"
measurements while it might be "peaked-up" for just "photometry"
measurements.

	There might be more background and PSF matching going on than
your proposed definition would suggest.

	They're not regenerated.  New ones are generated.

	We've always said we're only required to serve events to a few
brokers who then distribute them to the community.  This area is fraught
with land mines.

	The light curve is of the DIAObject, not of the Object, and it
is composed of DIASources.  I don't see any philosophical problem with
that.

	If the DIASource is not associated with a prior DIAObject or
SSObject, a DIAObject will be created for it.

	Yes, that is the current intent.  But the newer ones will be
better.

	I'm not sure I understand this Bad Thing.  Are you saying that a
given transient should generate only one alert?  I don't think that's
ever been the case, but brokers can filter out recurrent alerts if they
choose.
