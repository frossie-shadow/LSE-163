Hi Mario - My main comments are:

  * page 3: Clarify that the Level 1 reductions will be re-done with every Level 2 run.

  * page 5: Not sure that the source forced flux on the calexp will be useful in all cases (e.g. 
supernovae).  Is there a way to distinguish when this value is or is not trustworthy?

  * page 6: There will a ton of precovery forced photometry coming from Solar System objects until 
our SSObject table becomes comprehensive.

  * page 6: Tracklets comes from the 2 snaps, yes?  Or from the 2 sets of snaps per night?  Would be 
good to clarify.

  * page 9: I don't know if we currently store the S/N anything was detected at (I may be wrong 
though).  Is there a reason to not use psFlux/psFluxStdev?

  * page 12: I don't know if we need to store entries in the DIAObject table that would more 
naturally go in the Object table (proper motion and parallax come to mind).

  * page 16: The Pogson magnitudes table, with negative values = NULL, is a bit dangerous as there 
is the potential to be misused.  E.g. for QSOs you will only get half the data.

  * page 20: It does seem a bit strange to say that will serve as a broker, but users can't receive 
an unfiltered stream. The former seems harder than the latter; how do our computational requirements 
scale with the number of listeners?

Cheers,
Andy
