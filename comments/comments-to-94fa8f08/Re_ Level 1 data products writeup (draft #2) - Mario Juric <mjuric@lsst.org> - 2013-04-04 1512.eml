Hi Mike,

You're right, I'll change it.

Not formally, but this document is the proposal to make that decision.

The feedback I got for version #1 (btw., it's all archived at
https://dev.lsstcorp.org/cgit/contrib/data_products.git/) was unanimous
in preferring data to URIs.

No. I'm not sure if there's a standardized query/filtering language, so
every broker is permitted to come up with it's own. I'll check with VO
gurus about that.

Because our system may not be able to handle it -- if we had 100 users
all requesting the full data stream, that may quickly grow into
Gbits/sec (we need to estimate those numbers). I want to set the
expectation low.

We're embracing the VO standards (VOEvent, and VOEvent Transport
Protocol), but I don't think we're extending them (yet?).

The filtering language and mechanisms for Event Brokers are unspecified
and implementation specific (to my knowledge). If we needed to deploy
our own "bare bones" broker, we'd allow filters specified with snippets
of code (e.g., Python), or some a declarative SQL-ish language
(Jacek/K-T, is there something standard the industry uses for filtering
streams of data?).

Note that all of this is to satisfy the often overlooked statement in
the SRD that states that:

  "The users will have an option of a query-like pre-filtering of this
   data stream in order to select likely candidates for specific
   transient type. Users may also query the LSST science database at
   any time for additional information that may be useful, such as the
   properties of static objects that are positionally close to the
   candidate transients. Several pre-defined filters optimized for
   traditionally popular transients, such as supernovae and microlensed
   sources, will also be available, as well as the ability to add new
   pre-defined filters as the survey continues."

Cheers,
