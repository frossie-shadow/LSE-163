?? I'm not suggesting that the tables be deleted, just moved to the end of the 
doc.

I'm not advocating change, just clarity.

You and I understand that; a person external to the project may not. I'm not 
sure the technical difference is worth explaining, given the scope of this 
document. If it is, let's explain it more fully.

Sure. My point was to elaborate on the definition since it lies at the very 
heart of generating L-1 data products.

Right. Which is why I suggested trying to excise the policy stuff from the 
technical definition doc.

Yes but the sentence says the association will return "one and only one" which 
seems to run counter to the rest of the text.

The problem is that in the stack of images that go into any given patch of 
sky, there will be some bright transients (asteroids) that appear in one image 
but not the others. If the template is co-added without filtering out these 
transients, then the system will issue an alert _every time_ that patch of sky 
is observed. This is not so bad for SNe but is a bother for SSOs: those alerts 
would be bogus, of course, but they are avoidable. Yes, smart brokers can 
filter them out but why make the problem harder for users?

Really, though, my uber-point is to say something about how templates are 
created, and to address fairly obvious implications for issuing alerts based 
on DIA.
