Hi Mario,,
Brief comments on your lst page:

 YES, I AGREE:
Don't use the term 'transient' to refer to all DIASources. This causes
confusion and is inconsistent with the usual meaning of transient as
impermanent astrophysical source, lasting only for a short time. The
term transient alert will also need to be changed.

YES:
 Is Level 1 database required to be relational?. A no-SQL solution may
be more appropriate given the use cases envisioned so far.


I THINK WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH MOVING OBJECTS BECAUSE OF THE NEED FOR 
SPEC FOLLOWUP OF REAL TRANSIENTS.  IN FACT, ONE MIGHT ARGUE THAT SINCE 
THE 60 SEC IS MAINLY DRIVEN BY THAT, WE SHOULD MINIMIZE THE FALSE ALARM 
RATE DUE TO MOVING OBJECTS INCLUDING DEBRIS:
  Will LSST provide a limited-capability event broker, as described in
x2.4.2? The SRD seems to demand it, but the opposing view is that
it's not clear how useful it would be (and it's not useful, we shouldn't
waste resources to provide it).

MAYBE THIS IS RELATED:
Should we broadcast alerts to Solar System objects?. I think the an-
swer is yes { otherwise we will need to devise a separate mechanism to
distribute orbit updates. This needs to be added to the document.

Tony
