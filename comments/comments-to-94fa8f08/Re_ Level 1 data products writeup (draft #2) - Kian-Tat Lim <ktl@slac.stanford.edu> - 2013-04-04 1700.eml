Mario,

	My comments on this draft:

2.2.1

#4: Need to associate to two SSObject positions -- propagated and template-time
 (one will be positive, other will be negative)

#4 footnote 6: Document assumption that multiple DIASources will not match
 to one DIAObject to prevent multiple updates

#7: Are L2DB Object matches to DIASources or DIAObjects?
 * If the former, this is a pretty big but narrow match table
 * If the latter, this is only for new DIAObjects and is easier/faster

#8: query time == time when database has been updated with new DIAObject
 measurements?
 * Can we batch up updates and have them all appear at same time?

#9: Precovery only for new DIAObjects, right?  Or old ones, too?
 * Equivalent to doing forced photom of all DIAObjects on each diffim
 * Diffims are not cached; would have to cache or recompute on the fly
 * Precovery inserts into DIASource table? or DIAForcedPhotom table?
   + If DIASource, which columns are missing, if any?

2.2.2

#4: Points to new SSObject record, not DIAObject

2.3.6

#2: Retrieving all historic images for a given location on the sky within
 24 hours may not be possible (would require average of one tape read per
 minute or so) -- or we have to keep all calexps on disk
