Hi Mario,

Here are some tardy but, I hope, useful comments on your draft description of 
the LSST data products. In general I think the scope is about right, as is the 
level of detail. There is plenty of opportunity for wordsmithing and fixing 
typos, grammatical rough patches, etc. but I won't bother with any of that 
here.

Cheers,
Dick

1. I found the document to be a difficult read, which I think can be fixed 
with some reorganization. The flow can be improved fairly dramatically by 
doing the following:

   - move the description of the database tables to appendices
   - move bullet lists of changes w.r.t. previous baseline to the end of 
document
   - move much of the substantial content now in footnotes to the main text 
(poster child example: footnote 15).
   - eliminate footnotes that are too technical to be interesting or helpful 
(ex: footnotes 7, 13, 35, 38)

2. In the end I found it hard to understand at a high level what the data 
products really are without parsing the whole document. It would be better I 
think to introduce the products (maybe list them in a table), then talk about 
how they are produced, then give details of the contents. A reader would have 
to read footnote 37 on page 16 before discovering that processed images are 
going to be a published data product. My recollection is that users will be 
able to request any calibrated image cut-out, but it will in general be 
regenerated on-the-fly as these products will not be preserved very long. Is 
this still true? If so the document should say so. Similar comment applies to 
difference images.

3. There are quite a few instances of technical terms that are not defined 
when first used. "ISR," "MOPS," "broker," and "forced-photometry" are 
examples, and it is not clear whether the latter term is meaningfully 
different than "photometry" in this context. The definition of "difference 
image" would benefit from embellishment. I would say it is "an arithmetic 
difference of two images that have been warped to the same geometric grid and 
photometrically scaled" and elaborate that the difference is expected to be 
zero within the noise, except for sources that are new or that have changed in 
brightness.

4. Some terminology is problematic. For instance, in much of the document the 
term "VO Event" seems to be a synonym for "Alert" when of course it is not. A 
VOEvent is a serialization of an Alert, or notification of a discovery of a 
new DIASource. I think I would replace all occurrences of "VOEvent" with 
"Alert" until sect. 2.4.2, where VOEvent is defined.

For political correctness, I think I would rephrase the first paragraph in 
sect. 2.4.2 to indicate that the project plans to use a community standard 
protocol for conveying alerts, and that the most developed standard today is 
VOEvent (cite ref). With the demise of VAO, this approach seems more prudent 
to me.

5. There are a few logical inconsistencies and outright contradictions that 
need to be fixed.

   - Sect. 2.3.5: the logic for representing brightnesses as flux rather than 
magnitudes is muddled. For instance if a DIASource is a variable star, a 
negative flux merely means that the star was dimmer w.r.t. the template. The 
brightness (or brightness difference) could clearly be represented in 
magnitudes in this case. Thus the statement in parg. 4 (negative fluxes->NULL) 
does not follow.

   - Sect. 2.3.7, parg. 1: '...DIASources are never re-measured at the pixel 
level" is not consistent with paragraphs 3 and following, where the 
regeneration of DIASources is described in detail.

   - Sect. 2.4.2: I don't see what would stop someone from getting the full 
event stream by merely writing a suitably trivial filter in the "bare bones" 
broker that LSST provides. It also seems like an avoidably horrible thing to 
scale LSST/DM to issue alerts within 60s, only to claim it has too few 
resources to serve the events to more than a few. I think this needs to be 
thought through, and the discussion in the last paragraph is too vague to be 
useful. The policy discussion needs to be moved to a different document.

   - Sect. 2.3: the claim of philosophical purity re: the distinction of 
positional association and identity is diluted by including light curves in 
the alert payload. Also, in footnote 6: "the [association] algorithm will take 
into account... [various things]... to find the _maximally likely_ match." 
(BTW, in footnote 6 you surely meant to say that the association algorithm 
guarantees that a DIASource is associated with _one or zero_ DIAObject or 
SSObject, yes?)

   - Table 1, fpSky and fpSkyStdev: why are the units in DN? (and where is DN 
defined?) If the units of source brightness are physical flux or mags, how 
would a sky brightness in DN be useful to users?

6. A few details are needed on this points:

- Sect. 2.3.7: the discussion of updating the Level 1 database is confusing, 
and I wonder if "less is more" in this case? Will old versions of the Level 1 
databases be retained and accessible?

- The concept of a template is introduced early, but that begs the question of 
how they are created. Will they be cleansed of transients, or SSOs? Our last 
DRB just averaged the input frames (with outlier rejection, I believe). But if 
we did that, then presumably we would always issue alerts at the position of 
brighter transients, which would be a Bad Thing.

7. Some details are not needed:

- Sect. 2.3.7, parg 4: I think I would omit details like how long you think it 
will take to run the annual DRP.

- Sect. 2.3.8, last parg.: this sentence has too much jargon. I think I would 
omit the SQL examples entirely, as they don't add much to the discussion.
